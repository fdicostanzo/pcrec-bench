# pcrecbench/ — the harness package

`python3 -m pcrecbench run --subbench email --testee pcre2-jit` measures one
CELL and writes one RECORD. The spec is `docs/design/harness_contract.md`;
the record's shape is `docs/design/record_schema.md`.

| file | role |
|---|---|
| `__main__.py` | the CLI: `run`, `index`, `quiet`, `testees`, `report` (a stub pointing at [B5]) |
| `harness.py` | contract §4's seven steps; `outcome_for()` is the ONE place an engine's answer becomes a `match_outcome` |
| `subbench.py` | loads `bench/<name>/`; owns the regime→subject mapping and `subbench.content_hash` |
| `adapters.py` | the `Adapter` interface, discovery, and **the DRIVER PROTOCOL** (in full, at the top of the file) |
| `driverrun.py` | build/run/parse a driver; the resume-after-driver-death rule |
| `record.py` | builds the record dict; every derived id comes FROM `schema/validate.py`'s own functions |
| `store.py` | the store path rule, never-clobber, validate-before-write, the index |
| `quiet.py` | the quiet-box instrument and its two thresholds (`docs/design/quiet_baseline.md`) |
| `env.py` | the `environment` block; the machine registry |
| `oracle_pcre2.py` | the libpcre2 ctypes binding, copied from pcrec (see its header) and extended |

## Three rules that are not obvious from the code

**The harness judges; the adapter answers.** An adapter reports what its
engine said. `harness.outcome_for()` decides what that means against the
sub-bench's expectation. An adapter that graded its own correctness would be
marking its own homework, and the outcome enum would stop being comparable
across engines.

**A record that fails validation is never written.** `store.write()` writes
to a temporary name, runs `schema/validate.py --check-filename` there, and
only then moves it into place. A validation failure is a HARNESS BUG, not a
measurement result, and it is reported as one.

**The harness judges by RANGE, not by lists it keeps in step by hand.** A
give-up is a give-up because the code fell inside bounds the ENGINE
reported (pcrec exports `[PCREC_ERR_FLOOR, -2]` from the artifact; pcre2
supplies its measured limit-code set). A code an engine adds later
classifies correctly with nobody editing `harness.py`, and a reserved code
cannot be laundered into `gave-up` by an enumeration that fell behind.

**A pattern has FORMS, and they never share a row.** `Adapter.compile()`
returns a `CompiledPattern`: one `CompileResult` per form. Most engines
have one (`plain`) because they anchor with runtime options; pcrec has no
end-anchored mode, so it compiles `(?:pattern)\z` as a second artifact and
the match regime is measured on that one. Both are timed and both get
compile rows — rule X27 rejects a `whole-subject` match row whose record
does not witness its compile.

**The store claims a name with `O_EXCL`, never `exists()`-then-write.** An
exists-then-write pair is the race the `-<n>` disambiguator exists to
prevent, reintroduced by the way it was checked. Staging is one temp
directory per write, not one shared one — the race control caught that too.

**Derivations are imported, never reimplemented.** `record.py` loads
`schema/validate.py` as a module and calls its `derive_record_id`,
`derive_testee_id` and `compute_content_hash`. Two implementations of one
derivation is the check-design failure pcrec has paid for repeatedly: the
check and the thing it checks must not share an author's second guess.

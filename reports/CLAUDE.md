# reports/ — generated reports over the store

Each file is the output of one `python3 -m pcrecbench report ...` query,
committed beside the records it reduces so a reader can cite a number
with its query. Names: `<date>-<subbench>-<version>-<machine>[-<label>][.<grain>].md|tsv`.

**Reports are RE-RENDERED when the reporter changes** ([B9], 2026-08-25):
the STORED RECORDS are the data; a report is a VIEW over them, and the
view is versioned separately (`reporter: vN (date)`, a header line every
render carries — `pcrecbench/report.py`'s `REPORTER_VERSION`). When
`report.py`'s rendering changes, every committed report is regenerated
with the SAME QUERY that produced it (named in its own header) so the
file keeps its identity (the same records, the same filters) while
picking up the new columns/rulings. `report … | diff - <file>` is empty
immediately after a regeneration — the reporter is deterministic, so a
non-empty diff after a bare rerun (no query change, no reporter change)
means either the store changed or the reporter regressed determinism.

Both sample sets below were regenerated at [B9] (2026-08-25) against
reporter `v2 (2026-08-25)`: new columns (`status`, `fact`, `vs best`,
mechanism stamps, phase splits, etc. — see `pcrecbench/report.py`'s
module docstring for the full R1-R9 ruling list) mean these files no
longer diff byte-identical against their pre-[B9] versions, but each
still answers the SAME query as before.

- `2026-08-25-email-specimen-0.1-budu-ryzen1600.md` — the FIRST
  PRODUCTION SAMPLE: email-specimen@0.1 × {pcre2-interp, pcre2-jit,
  pcrec-auto, pcrec-nocaps, pcrec-vm} at pin 8da6120, 5 trials, pinned
  to CPU 11, in a quiet window coordinated with the pcrec manager
  session (02:22-02:56 EDT); set grain. `.subject-grain.md` the
  per-subject drill-down; `.tsv` the machine-readable form. Query:
  `--subbench email-specimen --until 2026-08-25T07:00:00Z` — the
  `--until` bound is NOW REQUIRED to reproduce this exact 5-record
  snapshot ([B9] regeneration note): the store has since grown past this
  sample's original "only 5 records exist yet" window (the re-pin
  sample below, and OD-B15's newest-wins dedup, would otherwise pull
  later records of the SAME testee_ids into what this file's name
  claims is the pin-8da6120-only sample).
- `2026-08-25-email-specimen-0.1-budu-ryzen1600-repin-692c2e8.md` — the
  RE-PIN SAMPLE ([B8]): the same six cells re-measured after pcrec's
  re-pin to `692c2e8` (the caller-provided frame-buffer testees added,
  `pcrec-vm-in` measured), alongside the surviving pin-8da6120 records
  and the store's own re-measurements: a second libpcre2-interp run
  (17:34, under load) landed `inconclusive-load` and, per OD-B15's
  AMENDED dedup rule ([B9], 2026-08-25 — a newer non-measured record is
  not evidence against an older measured one and does not supersede it),
  does NOT replace the original 06:22 measured record — it is listed
  under the header as "newer, not measured" instead, and the 06:22
  record is what the ranking tables actually use; a second libpcre2-jit
  run (17:41) DID land `measured`, so it supersedes the first jit record
  under the ordinary newest-measured-wins rule (see the header's
  "superseded records" line). Query: `--subbench email-specimen` (no
  bound needed: every record this sample was drawn from already existed
  when it was first generated). `.subject-grain.md` the per-subject
  drill-down; `.tsv` the machine-readable form. Read alongside
  `docs/dev/feedback_pcrecdev1_2026-08-25-repin.md` (the pcrec manager's
  reading that became [B9]'s R1-R9 rulings) and
  `docs/dev/feedback_pcrecdev1_2026-08-25.md`.

**A note on what [B9]'s own rulings changed in this store's numbers**:
applying R1 (OD-B14: a non-`measured` row is excluded from ranking by
default) to the re-pin sample means two of the four `692c2e8` pcrec
testees (`auto-caps`, `auto-nocaps`) are `inconclusive-load` and have NO
measured record at all yet, so they are UNRANKED in every table (see
their "not ranked" lines) unless `--include-unmeasured` is passed — a
re-measure of those two on a quiet box would rank them. The DEFAULT
baseline testee (`libpcre2 engine_mode=interp`, named in every table
title) IS ranked, using its original 06:22 measured record: R2/OD-B15
was AMENDED (manager, 2026-08-25, before this lane's merge) specifically
because the first cut of the dedup rule — newest record wins regardless
of status — would have let interp's later `inconclusive-load` re-measure
silently displace its earlier measured one and vanish from every table's
baseline; the amended rule (newest MEASURED record wins; a newer
non-measured one is listed separately, never treated as evidence against
an older measured one) restores it.

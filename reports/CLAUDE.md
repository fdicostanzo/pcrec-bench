# reports/ — generated reports over the store

Each file is the output of one `python3 -m pcrecbench report ...` query,
committed beside the records it reduces so a reader can cite a number
with its query. Names: `<date>-<subbench>-<version>-<machine>[.<grain>].md|tsv`.
Regenerate with the query in the file's header; the reduction is the
reporter's, the raw trials stay in store/.

  PRODUCTION SAMPLE: email-specimen@0.1 × {pcre2-interp, pcre2-jit,
  pcrec-auto, pcrec-nocaps, pcrec-vm} at pin 8da6120, 5 trials, pinned
  to CPU 11, in a quiet window coordinated with the pcrec manager
  session (02:22-02:56 EDT); set grain. `.subject-grain.md` the
  per-subject drill-down; `.tsv` the machine-readable form.
